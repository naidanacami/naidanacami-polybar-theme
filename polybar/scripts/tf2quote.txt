It was fun
Ain't over till it's over
Until next time, then
Second star to the right
Go get 'em, tiger
Make it so
See you on the other side
Wait for the wheel
Do not throw your shot
Drop and burn 'em up
Exhibit no restraint
Rip and saw
Code zero zero zero. Destruct. Zero
Authorization Alpha-Alpha 3-0-5
Have just the greatest day
Avenge me
Stay safe
Situation normal
PROTOCOL <3 
Fly, you fool
Never give up. Never surrender
In case of doubt, attack
Youâ€™re never beaten until you admit it
Wrong us, shall we not revenge? 
Till all are one
Nothing but the rain. 
Sometimes, you have to roll a hard six
And sometimes, when you fall, you fly
See you space cowboy...
Just another day at the office
End of line
Fortune favors the bold
A leaf on the wind
You are who you choose to be
Always
Finish the fight
It won't lit
